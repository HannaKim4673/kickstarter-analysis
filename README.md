## Findings
* It would be best to run the campaign in either May or June, since those are the months with the highest success rates, and the largest gap between successful campaigns and failed ones. 
* Also, Louise should try to lower her goal to around $5,000 if possible, because campaigns with really high goals tended to fail a lot.
